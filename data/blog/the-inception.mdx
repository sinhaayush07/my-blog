# The Inception ðŸŽ‰

For the longest time after trying so many static generators. Finally,
we are here with Next.js and Tailwind's blessing. Vercel blessed us with
hosting. So finally the slate to write the blog has been unleashed.

## Why Next.js?

After checking the site [generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/) it was an
obvious choice to use Next.js for the comfort of use and almost hassle-free nature.
It will be very easy to put blogs and generate other meta around it easily.
