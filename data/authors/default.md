Rishabh a.k.a stalwart201 is an engineer with a passion for crafting intuitive user experiences. With over 5 years of experience working in MNC and startup organizations, he has gained the ability to think outside the box and acquired the agility to derive quick and efficient results. His core competence lies in being able to visualize effective interfaces and write scalable APIs to back them.

He is a Frontend Engineer at [CleverTap](https://clevertap.com) in Mumbai, India. When not working he likes to play MOBA games like Dota2, League of legends. Loves cooking food as well, but currently food choices are limited due to food allergies. Hopefully these allergens be weakening with time.

You will most likely find him exploring something around web, hybrid apps or stalking design and creatives at dribbble. Learning figma currently!
