Hi! I am Ayush. I am an engineer and a musician. I like to code, and I like to wander.

I'm a Frontend Engineer at [CleverTap](https://clevertap.com) in Mumbai, India. I've been a Frontend engineer for more than 5 years now, with a touch of backend code here and there every now and then.

When I'm not working, you'd find me reading a book, wandering, playing something on any instrument with strings. Just Kidding. I only know ukelele and guitar.

You will most likely find him exploring something around web, hybrid apps or stalking design and creatives at dribbble. Learning figma currently!
